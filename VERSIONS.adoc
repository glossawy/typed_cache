== Unreleased

* feat: Added `fetch_all` method to `Store` interface.
* feat: Instrumented `fetch_all` method, without instrumenting nested cache calls.
* feat(rails): Added a Railtie to automatically configure the gem when Rails is present.
* feat(sorbet): Added public API for gem under rbi directory.
* feat(namespaces): `.at` now accepts multiple arguments, automatically chaining with the appropriate delimiter.
* feat(namespaces): Added `#join` method to `Namespace` to explicitly join multiple namespaces, with or without custom key factories.

* fix(rbs): Adjusted some erroneous RBS comments.

* chore(sorbet): Initialized sorbet via tapioca.

* internal: Added a `cached` factory method to `Snapshot`.

== 0.2.0

* refactor(instrumentation): Reworked the `CacheBuilder`'s instrumentation API for clarity and flexibility. The `with_instrumentation` method now accepts `:rails`, `:dry`, `:default` (null), or a custom instrumenter instance directly.
* fix(instrumentation): Corrected a bug where instrumenters would still publish events even when `config.instrumentation.enabled` was set to `false`.
* fix(instrumentation): Allowed subscriptions to be registered on disabled instrumenters; they will simply not fire any events.
* feat(docs): Overhauled the `README.md` and `examples.md` to be more comprehensive, featuring the `CacheRef` API more prominently and adding detailed examples for custom backends and instrumenters.
* test(core): Added extensive test coverage for the `CacheBuilder` and instrumentation logic to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.
* chore(tests): Refactored test suites to improve clarity and maintainability by adhering to a "one expectation per example" convention and using `let` blocks for setup.
