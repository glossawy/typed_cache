module TypedCache
  # Marker mixin for concrete cache back-ends.
  # A Backend *is* a Store, but the reverse is not necessarily true (decorators also
  # include Store). By tagging back-ends with this module we can type-check and
  # register them separately from decorators.
  #
  # Back-ends should *not* assume they wrap another store â€“ they are the leaf nodes
  # that actually persist data.
